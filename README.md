#Context
Photos of your friends from your last shared experience are scattered all over the web, on various profile pages and over different social media venues. Snippit aggregates them into one place and displays them in immersive photo albums called snips. Snips can be easily created, edited, and shared to bring disperate memories together into a relivable experience


#How to Use
